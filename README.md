🔹 Overall Employees: A snapshot of the total workforce, providing a clear view of headcount.

🔹 Attrition Insights: Comprehensive analysis of attrition, including:
- Total Attrition: Count of employees who have left the organization.
- Attrition Rate: Percentage calculation, offering insights into turnover trends.
- Active Employees: Segregation of current employees for ongoing resource planning.

🔹 Demographic Analysis:
 - Average Age: Average age of employees, offering insights into workforce maturity.
 - Age Group Breakdown: Visualization of employees across various age bands.
 - Attrition Rate by Gender and Age Group: Detailed insights into how attrition varies across demographics.
   
-  Department-wise Attrition: Attrition rates across departments, helping identify areas requiring attention.
- Job Satisfaction Rating: An overview of employee satisfaction, crucial for understanding engagement and morale.
- Education Field-wise Attrition: Analysis of attrition based on educational background, aiding in recruitment strategy.

This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for HR decision-making, helping organizations proactively address workforce challenges and enhance employee experience.

### 3. Sales Performance Dashboard in Power BI
In this project, I built a Power BI dashboard to explore and present key sales insights. The goal was to provide a clear, data-driven picture of business performance, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions. Here's what I achieved:

-🔹Key Features & Insights:
- Total Sales and Gross Sales: This helped create a quick overview of how the business was performing financially.
= Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and Profit: I tracked COGS and calculated profit margins to show how each segment contributed to the bottom line. This provided a better understanding of where profitability was strongest and where improvements could be made.
= Sales by Month: I created time-series visuals to break down monthly sales trends to spot seasonality patterns and predict future performance.
= Top 3 Products by Segment: To showcase the best-performing products, I identified the top three products in each segment, such as Government and Midmarket. This helped highlight which products drove the most sales.
= Sales by Country: I mapped out sales by country, giving a clear view of regional performance. This allowed for a deeper understanding of which markets were thriving and where new opportunities might lie.
